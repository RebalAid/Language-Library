# Introduction
Python is a C-like, general purpose, interpreted, garbage collected, dynamically-typed, object-oriented/multi-paradigm-orientated (OOP, functional and proceedural), high level programming language.

To dissect what I mean;

1. C-like; Based and built around the C programming language.
2. General purpose; You can pretty much program and build anything you want, without limits.
3. Interpreted; translate the code into a machine readable code at runtime by it.
4. Garbage collected; automatic form of memory management, cleans up memory that is no longer used by the software.
5. Dynamically-typed; You don't have to specify or declare a variable, it does it for you.
6. Object-oriented/Multi-paradigm: While it is heavily focused on the OOP side, it can also be programmed as functional or proceedural, making it flexible between the two.
7. High Level; Human readable syntax, abstracted, and easy to maintain by beginner or seasoned programmers. But its limits do include not having access at a hardware level, only at the software level.

# History
Python was developed in 1989 to 1991, by Guido van Rossum, and as worked at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. Guido wanted to create a high level programming language that was powerful, but also readable by humans to understand. Python is licensed under the GPL or GPL commpatible license; Python Software Foundation License. Python was named after a comedy show series Monty Python's Flying Circus on the BBC (british broadcasting corporation) television. He was later referred to as "Benevolent Dictator for Life" by the community, however in 2018, he later disbanded the title and later the Python programming language is nowadays (2018-2026 and on going) handled by the Python Software Corporation. 

The first release of the python language was 0.9.0 (or 0.9) which was on Feburary 1991, to which I believe is a alpha or beta version of the language in todays standards. 
The second release was python 2.0, which is nowadays deprecated and no longer being worked on as of writing. The last version being 2.7.17.
Python 3.0 (and onwards, either security maintained or released stable), which nowadays the current version of that is 3.14 (and probably 3.15 or 3.16 depending on what future your viewing in). But whats different about is that it includes new features and as such, but I guess there is nothing special to it after all.

# Why should I learn Python and whats the benefit?
The reason why you should or could learn python is that it is a high level programming language, which is why the syntax is clear as day that is english based, but not without its limits; High level means that it has access to the higher part of the food chain, the software. You can't go beyound that and have access to the hardware-level access. Another thing is that, while OOP/object orientated, you can program it the you wanted it to be, it could be simply be based on logic or by data, or by official means like functional and procedural programming, which style is your choice is always up to you. Another thing I would like to mention is its simplicity, even though I mentioned that it is high level, I want to explain; You can easily learn python because of its human readable, english based syntax, and you don't have to worry about memory management, the garbage collector does it for you.

I will do it later.
