# Language-Library
Any programming programming language, for educational and learning for those who are new to any type of programming languages, serves as a hub for both projects (Real or not) and wikis (Code examples or explanations).

# Overview
A language library for all kinds of programming languages, either you are new or not. We include code snippets and projects for you to set up an example, even if these are as imperfect as any other code source. However, some programming languages have their own learning curves and it is sometimes recommended to have a previous experience in programming, or some sort of concepts such as functions for example. And because of that, programming languages aren't designed to be the same. However, because they weren't designed the same, you could pretty much learn a language and still learn the same, variables, functions, print and comment statements, etc.

# Anyone, for everybody!
Your welcome to learn any language as you wish, even if you try to challenge yourself for better flexibility across all languages. So feel free to learn from anybody who may want to add extra tips or extra learning material on our part (That being the original owner and the contributors, of course).
