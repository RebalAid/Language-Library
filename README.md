# Language-Library
Any programming programming language, for educational and learning for those who are new to any type of programming languages, serves as a hub for both projects (Real or not) and wikis (Code examples or explanations).

# Overview
A language library for all kinds of programming languages, either you are new or not. We include code snippets and projects for you to set up an example, even if these are as imperfect as any other code source.
