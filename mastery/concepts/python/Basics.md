# Basics
In order to start programming, you need these things instead:

1. Download python, specifically from python.org (If you are using Linux, you don't need this step)
2. A code editor (Zed) or an IDE (VSCodium) is recommended, but for terminal users, Vim, NeoVim, or extra (non-terminal) like Gnu Emacs is optional.
3. Creating a file using the official file extension for python is .py (e.g main.py). As according to the official sources.

So while you have created a file named main.py, try to edit in a code editor or IDE or something else as described above.

# Python Basics
## Comments
comments are human readable, with the use of this instead:
```# Hello, this is a first line comment ```
A first line comment is what python officially supports, unfortunely, there is no such thing as a multi-line comment, the only work around is this:

```
"""This is a multi-line comment btw
And can also hold up anything you want to write in
even if it is a license, a copyright, or whatever."""
```

The multi-line comment is what's officially support by python.
Forgot to mention: Comments aren't outputed by python interpreter.

## Print statement
to write your first python code, you write this instead.
```print("Hello World!")```
let me explain in depth real quick.

`print()` is a function, a function that is built-in in python.

### What is a function?
A function is a re-usable code designed to perform a specific kind of operation. For example, `print()` is a function designed for a specific task. And that task being to print text.
Another example, the `input()` is a function designed to get the user to input their data, that is a string, an interger, or whatever.

But for now, all you need to know is that the `print()` function is designed to print an output.

### Back on topic
`("hello world!")`
This is a paramator, we used the paramator to include what we want it out to be outputed.

### What is the difference between arguments and paramators?
Argument: Are values which we pass in when we call function and provide a value.
Paramaters: Are variables in the paratensis "()" when we define a function.

In `print("")` is a function, and we need to use the paramators to output what we want. Its not an argument because didn't exactly created a function ourselves yet, but thats a topic for another time.

## Python print statement
```print("Hello World")```
will be outputted as a result.
So congrats, you just made your own python program.

# Whats next?
Next we will be learning about Variables, Datatypes, and typecasting. As well as making our own useful program we want to make.
